NAME
    WebMoney::WMSigner - WebMoney signer module

SYNOPSIS
      use WebMoney::WMSigner;

      my $signed_str = WebMoney::WMSigner::sign( $wmid, $passwd, $path_to_keyfile, $str_to_sign );

DESCRIPTION
    This is signer module that signs any data using specified WebMoney key
    file. Key file is protected by password. See more details at
    http://www.webmoney.ru.

    In the original WMSigner distribution
    (http://download.webmoney.ru/WMSigner.zip) signer is implemented as an
    external command-line utility - this is not very convenient interface.
    This module implements native Perl interface without using any external
    command-line utilities. WMSigner code is compiled as XS module - this
    makes many advantages.

EXPORT
    None by default.
